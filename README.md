# 🚀 DSA Starter Pack

A structured and beginner-friendly **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository implemented in **Python**.  
This repository is designed as a learning and practice resource to build strong problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and algorithmic thinking — especially for coding interviews and technical assessments.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Provide clear and readable Python implementations of core DSA concepts  
- Help learners understand logic behind algorithms, not just code  
- Serve as a personal revision and practice resource  
- Prepare students and developers for technical interviews
